# oscillart + tribute!
This is a website where you can enter any music notes (including notes outside C major, but the enharmonic sharp versions of each), and it displays the sine wave of each frequency. You can change the theme of the page, to pay tribute to my favourite album covers :). 

## why I made this
I loved the idea of [tribute](tribute.athena.hackclub.com), but I wanted to stretch myself further! and I have a strong background in music, so oscillart seemed perfect for me as it combined music and coding.
## how I made this
Followed the oscillart tutorial and did some research to add my own aspects (adding fill, changing css based on radio input, changing wave type)
## what I struggled with and what I learned
- learnt about audio.ctx
- struggled with getting the fill right
- learnt about sine waves
- learnt about canvas
- learnt how to record and save things in javascript on a website
